# Django MPESA Integration

This Django application is designed to facilitate MPESA payments, incorporating features for Customer to Business (C2B), Business to Customer (B2C), and STK Push transactions. It provides a robust backend implementation to interact with the MPESA API, handle authentication, process payment requests, and manage callbacks for real-time payment notifications.

## Features

- Secure authentication with MPESA API using OAuth tokens.
- Implementation of STK Push to initiate customer payments.
- B2C transaction support for business-initiated customer payments.
- Asynchronous request handling for efficient API communication.
- Callback endpoints for transaction status updates.
- Comprehensive logging and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following requirements installed before setting up the project:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 3.1 or later (for async views and ORM support)
- A valid set of MPESA API credentials

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-mpesa-integration.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd django-mpesa-integration

```

## Configuration

Fill in your MPESA API credentials and other necessary configurations in your project's `settings.py` file:

```python
# Example configuration
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY = 'your_consumer_key'
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'your_consumer_secret'
MPESA_SHORTCODE = 'your_shortcode'
# ...other configurations
```

## Usage

Start the Django development server to access the application endpoints:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Available Endpoints

- **POST /getauthtoken/**: Retrieve an OAuth token for MPESA API authentication.
- **POST /stkpush/**: Initiate an STK Push transaction to prompt user payments.
- **POST /registerurl/**: Register MPESA confirmation and validation URLs.
- **POST /expresscallback/**: Receive STK Push payment callbacks from MPESA.
- **POST /b2c/**: Start a B2C payment process to send money to a customer.
- **POST /b2ccallback/**: Handle callbacks for B2C transaction updates.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your proposed feature or fix.
3. Submit a pull request targeting the `develop` branch for review.


Ensure your code passes all tests before submitting a pull request.

## Security

Sensitive data such as API keys and credentials should be stored in environment variables or Django's `settings.py` file with proper exclusions from version control.

Remember to replace `yourusername`, `your_consumer_key`, `your_consumer_secret`, `your_shortcode`, and
`your-email@example.com` with your actual GitHub username, MPESA API credentials
